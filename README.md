# Release Guard Usage

This repository demonstrates how to use the Release Guard tool in a real-world scenario. While the example project is intentionally simple, it provides a practical template that you can follow and adapt to your own needs.

> To learn more about the Release Guard project, visit the [original repository](https://github.com/jhonatademuner/release-guard) and check out the wiki for detailed documentation.

## Branches
To make the explanation easier to follow, weâ€™ll use branches with meaningful names. Each branch introduces a small change to the code. Although these changes may seem "useless" in practice, they serve to demonstrate how **Release Guard** behaves in different scenarios.
